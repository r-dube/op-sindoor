# BSF soldier's abduction by Pakistani rangers
In the plains of the Indian state of Punjab, agriculture over privately owned land is allowed all the way up to the international border.
On April 23, 2025, soon after the Pahalgam terrorist attack in the Indian union territory of Jammu and Kashmir, an Indian Border Security Force (BSF) soldier inadvertently crossed the international border between India and Pakistan.
To get him back, the Indian government likely apprehended a Pakistani ranger (equivalent to BSF) and arranged for a prisoner exchange after the four-day war between India and Pakistan ended.

## Agriculture in the border areas
In the border areas of Indian and Pakistani Punjab, agriculture is carried out lip-to-lip.
There is a fence on the Indian side of the border, but well away from the lip (i.e., the international border).
The fence can be crossed via built-in gates.

On the Indian side, farmers are allowed to cross the fence to tend to their crops.
However, this is done under the escort of a BSF jawan (soldier).
The soldier accompanies the farmers as they work and accompanies them back through the gate when done.

## Purnam Shaw's abduction
The international border between the two countries is easy to cross inadvertently - especially for someone new to the border - as there is no clear marker of the border between the fields.
On April 23, a day after the Pahalgam terrorist attack - before the enormity of the attack had truly sunk in among Indians - Purnam Shaw was escorting Indian farmers in Ferozpur, close to the Pakistan border.
Purnam was new to the area, although he had been with the BSF for 17 years.
He decided to take a rest break during his escort and inadvertently crossed the border.
Soon after, he was detained by Pakistani rangers.

Such inadvertent border crossings happen relatively frequently.
The Indian BSF and the Pakistani rangers have established protocols to handle such events.
Usually, a flag meeting is held between the BSF and the rangers, following which personnel are returned.
The return of personnel is not a quid pro quo - i.e., the side whose personnel has been detained does not have to give anything back in exchange for the return of the personnel.

Unfortunately for Purnam, his detention turned into an abduction.
The BSF and the rangers held multiple flag meetings to discuss his return. 
However, the rangers were under orders from "higher authorities" to hold on to him.

Pakistani rangers did release several photographs of Purnam, including one where he is shown blindfolded.
These photographs were likely released to put pressure on the BSF and the Indian government to negotiate with the Pakistani government.
The pattern of releasing photographs of Indian soldiers is consistent with Pakistan's actions in the past.

While in ranger custody, Purnam was mistreated.
For example, he was sleep-deprived and not allowed to brush his teeth.
Further, he was also blindfolded and moved multiple times.
Finally, he was interrogated every night.

Purnam remained in the ranger's custody for 21 days.

## BSF apprehends a ranger
The BSF was concerned about Purnam's safety.
Given the tensions between India and Pakistan following the Pahalgam terrorist attack and the subsequent four-day way, it is likely that the BSF was looking to even their leverage versus the rangers.

On May 04, the BSF detained a Pakistani ranger in the Indian state of Rajasthan.

The BSF and the Indian government have shared little information on the Pakistani ranger.
No photographs of the ranger were released.

However, negotiations likely resumed after the cessation of hostilities between India and Pakistan on May 10, and a quid pro quo prisoner exchange was arranged.

## Prisoner exchange frees Purnam
On May 14, 2025, Purnam was exchanged for the Pakistani ranger at the Attari-Wagah border.
